It contains the projects, AFCL Workflow files, JSON Files, Launches files, AWS and OPENFAAS configuration files, Mappings files,...

You told me to return it back tomorrow evening, but unfortunately I don't have more time, I work on another project now. 

But at least I send you the two first Tasks (Task1 and Task2) (as you said that the Task1 is mandatory) .

I implement them into Docker images and AWS(except I have some errors on Docker in deploying AWS  functions because I use Docker ToolBox on Windows 8, so I can't install the last version of Docker Desktop which works on Win 10).
